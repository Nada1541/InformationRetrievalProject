# CISI Information Retrieval Project
This project implements an information retrieval (IR) system using the CISI dataset, integrating preprocessing, indexing, retrieval models, and query expansion.
## Features
* Dataset: CISI dataset with documents, queries, and relevance judgments.
* Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and cleaning.
* Indexing: Custom inverted index and PyTerrier framework integration.
* Retrieval Models:
-BM25
-TF-IDF
Query Expansion: RM3-based query reformulation.
* Embedding Models:
-ELMo for semantic similarity.
-BERT for contextual embeddings.
